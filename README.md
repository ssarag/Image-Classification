#Image Classification with Flask Application



This repository contains a Flask application designed to perform image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The primary goal of this project is to classify images into one of six distinct classes with an achieved accuracy of 78% on the test set.

#Overview
The application utilizes a trained CNN model capable of analyzing and categorizing images into predefined classes. The model has been trained on a dataset encompassing various images from six distinct categories, enabling accurate classification within these classes.

Features
Image Classification: Upload images through the web interface to receive predictions on their class labels.
Six Classes: The model is trained to classify images into six different categories, ensuring a diverse range of recognizable objects or themes.
Flask Web Application: The classification functionality is integrated into a user-friendly web interface using Flask, allowing easy accessibility.

Model Details
The CNN model architecture employed in this project has been optimized for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved a test accuracy of 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and categorizing images within the specified classes.
